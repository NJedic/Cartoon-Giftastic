## Overview

A UI that grabs All of your Favorite Cartoon Gifs and compiles them in one place using the Giphy API! 

## Getting Started

* Launch the application [here!] 

* Click on any of the Pre-Existing Buttons to load 10 of the Gifs associated with that Cartoon as well as their Ratings!

* Create Buttons of your own by populating the "Thundercats Go!" Field and hitting "Submit". Your New Button will join the others at the top of the page - allowing it to be Clicked and your Gifs to be viewed!

**PRO TIP:** Click on the Gifs to watch them move!
